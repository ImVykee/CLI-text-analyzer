Simple CLI text analyzer made in Rust thats still WIP.  
Features (last updated on 18/2/2026 DD/MM/YYYY) :
 - pattern searcher (shows every line where the pattern is found)
 - pattern counter (shows every occurence of a pattern)
 - pattern replacer (replaces a pattern with another)
 - [WIP] file stats (shows file stats like number of words, most used words etc...)
